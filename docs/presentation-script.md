## English Pitch Script

🎤 **XStream — Simplifying Global Internet Access**

Hi everyone, my name is [Your Name], and I'm building an app called **XStream**.

1️⃣ **Vision** – XStream is a lightweight app that lets people reach global services like GitHub, ChatGPT, and social media from anywhere. I started it to help friends, then realized many others share the same challenge. Now I want to provide a reliable solution for everyone.

2️⃣ **The Problem** – IT pros can set things up, but it's still a hassle. For regular users, global sites are often out of reach due to restrictive networks and tricky configs.

3️⃣ **The Opportunity** – Our main users are developers, international students, and cross-border e-commerce teams. With the rise of AI and remote work, demand for easy global access keeps growing.

4️⃣ **The Solution** – We offer:
- ✅ Free self-hosted version for Windows, Linux, and macOS with open-source code and docs.
- ✅ 1-on-1 paid consulting for technical help.
- ✅ Premium features with cross‑platform sync across Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android.
- ✅ A future SaaS model for one‑click deployment.

5️⃣ **Why It's Better** – One app covers all major platforms, syncs with one account, and stays ad‑free even in the free tier.

6️⃣ **Sales & Marketing** – We'll publish XStream in app stores and promote via social media, offering referral rewards so users can earn premium time by inviting friends.

**Summary** – XStream aims to make global internet access simple for everyone. We're starting small but thinking big. Thank you!
